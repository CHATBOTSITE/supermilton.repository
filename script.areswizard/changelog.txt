          NEW FEATURE: yup, as most of you will probably be aware\anticipating.. we are 
                                   now bringing you Android App & Games!! 
                                  
                                    You'll find them in 'Browse Addons' - there's some cracking Android
                                    games available and an introduction to Emulators in the form of 
                                    SNES and MegaDrive/Genesis Games.. and every single one of
                                    them runs on my m8s box.. just goes to show what these neat
                                    little devices are capable of and that you don't need to spend
                                    a fortune to play some cracking games. (although you might want
                                    to invest in a compatible gamepad)

                                   Ares will even show you for free space and warn you if installing
                                   leaves you with less than 50Mb of free storage space. And you can
                                   uninstall any of the apps through the wizard too.

                                   When installing any of the Kodi forks\Modified versions, ares will                                    automatically install itself into the newly installed version ready to                                    install a build or apps in the new version too.
                                   

           added ability to login to achive.org if login is required (ie.. if the download has been 
           restricted by archive.org)

           fixed small bug in error handling for downloads


          Builders can now request a code to access their respective 'sections'.. to enable this
          simply add a line like this to the top of your wizard text\html\xml file:

                                             code="something"

          ..Ares will then only allow access should the user input the same code as what is set           in that line.. and with it being in your text file you can change it whenever you like.
